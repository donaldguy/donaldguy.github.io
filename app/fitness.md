Like many geeky youth, I managed to get through high school without much of a focus on health or fitness. Don't get me wrong, I played Rec league sports as a younger child. I even twice tried out for, and was twice cut from, varsity volleyball in high school (high school volleyball is pretty intense in Virginia Beach). But once that ship had sailed, I settled in and only had about as much physical activity as PE requirements dictated (and MIT's are more stringent than some colleges). With my enthusiasm for [beer](/beer) in college, probably the only reason I didn't get super fat was the 65 stairs I climbed to my dorm every day.

Nevertheless, coming out of college, I wasn't in great shape. Jumping into full-time work, I found myself gaining weight and feeling like crap. When I left that job I got [a personal trainer](www.linkedin.com/pub/rocco-venneri/21/1bb/387), which along with regular use of [Lose It!](http://loseit.com/) saw a decent amount of weight loss. But when I moved to New York and started at charity: water, things fell off again. When I left *that* job, I started up again in a more self-directed way. That pretty much brings us to the present.

#Engineering the Alpha
![Engineering the Alpha cover](https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1360564958l/15818381.jpg)
For the last 2 and 1/2 months, my fitness bible has been [this book](http://amzn.to/NIvuci) by [John Romaniello](http://www.romanfitnesssystems.com/) and [Adam Bornstein](http://www.bornfitness.com/). The truly appalling full is title _Man 2.0 Engineering the Alpha: A Real World Guide to an Unreal Life: Build More Muscle. Burn More Fat. Have More Sex_

To tell the truth, the title is so ... douchey, basically, that there is little chance I would have picked up the book off the shelf at Barnes & Nobel, or even naively from Amazon searching specifically for fitness books. The reason I did hear about the book is through the [Fitocracy](fitocracy.com) mailing list—I gather Roman is a contributing blog commenter so they let him promote that way.

I looked over the amazon reviews and thought _\*shrug\*_ what the heck?.

Overall I found the information pretty solid if cursory. I have said (e.g. in Episode 19 of [this](http://anhourwasted.mit.edu/) radio program) that it is overall a pretty good "Intro to [Bro Science](http://www.youtube.com/user/BroScienceLife)". I also enjoy Roman's voice and his framing of the journey of fitness and self-improvement within the idea of Joseph Campbell's [Monomyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth) / Hero's Journey. Even if (sorry, bro) some of the other geek-culture references sometimes seem a little forced at times—And the attempt to reclaim the word Alpha seems like overreach—it stoked my self-directed interest in fitness, and I appreciate that.

I am presently on week *13* of *16* of the book's program. It's going pretty well, I am down at least 10, probably 15 lbs. I can lift a lot more, I feel more comfortable in the gym. I got into it in the first place to feel better day to day, and so I am a bit miffed when I still feel crappy sometimes. ([Separately](/meditation), I am trying to learn to have general acceptance for these feelings) But overall, I think the book was a pretty good investment.

As I try to grow beyond simple "Intro"-level broscience, I have turned to some other resources. In particular, I have been slowly working my way through [my roommate](http://twitter.com/kasittig)'s copy of the classic [Starting Strength](http://amzn.to/1gZYYur). I haven't made tons of headway. (You can check my progress [on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_status/list/6462390)). So far I mostly just feel way worse at squats D:.

I also dropped a shiny dime on the [Precision Nutrition](http://www.precisionnutrition.com/books) system. It's website looks promising and based on my skimming of the material I am hoping it helps set me up to a place where I feel comfortable planning/cooking my own meals and being healthy *without counting calories*. I am somewhat annoyed that their Limited Time Only 50% Off sale keeps being extend. (I have complained before that it seems like literally all fitness products seem to use the scamiest marketing -- making it a virtually worthless signal for determining their quality).

Fitness and health are a process, and one I am still learning much about. When I have more thoughts to share, I shall add. If you have thoughts/suggestions, get at me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/donaldguy)
